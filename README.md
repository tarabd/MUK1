# MUK1

Guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF); involved in vesicle-mediated vacuolar transport, including Golgi-endosome trafficking and sorting through the multivesicular body (MVB); specifically stimulates the intrinsic guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Rab family members; partially redundant with GEF VPS9; required for localization of the CORVET complex to endosomesGuanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF); involved in vesicle-mediated vacuolar transport, including Golgi-endosome trafficking and sorting through the multivesicular body (MVB); specifically stimulates the intrinsic guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Rab family members; partially redundant with GEF VPS9; required for localization of the CORVET complex to endosomes
