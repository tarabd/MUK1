# MUK1

Guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) plays a part in vesicle-mediated vacuolar transport, as well as Golgi-endosome trafficking and sorting through the multivesicular bodies (MVB). It specifically stimulates the intrinsic guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Rab family members. It is partially redundant with GEF VPS9 and is required for localization of the CORVET complex to endosomesGuanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). It specifically stimulates the intrinsic guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Rab family members.

Sources written by Paulsel AL and Cabrera M tell that cells lacking both Vps9 and Muk1 closely phenocopy double and triple knock-out strains lacking Rab5 paralogs. Microscopy and overexpression experiments demonstrate that Vps9 and Muk1 have distinct localization determinants. These experiments establish Muk1 as the second Rab5 GEF in budding yeast.
In this context, we also uncover that Muk1 can compensate for loss of Vps9 in CORVET localization, indicating that two Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factors operate in the endocytic pathway.
